Overall the code works. To fix the problem that you've mentioned in the beginning.
On the Form look at properties and then you can edit the Text from Form1 to TextEditorMDI

Now the problems that I saw but I think you missed.

You have unnessessary imports:
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.ComponentModel;
	using System.Data;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Text;
	using System.Threading.Tasks;

Remember to delete imports you don't need after it's coded.
