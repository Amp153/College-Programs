Review of the program without looking at the code:
First off Texit Editor that misspelling is what the form is called. Also childForm2 is what the child forms are called I'd be fine with that if it didn't say a number. All of the buttons under the File tab work. I can add text to the children but the Window button doesn't show how many child forms there are. Nothing in the Format tab works and the only change I can see is that changing the font changes the size of the windows.

Now for the code:
Who coded this? All I can tell is that Db has something to do with their name.
Where are the comments? I only see one.
You have unnessessary imports:
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.ComponentModel;
	using System.Data;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Text;
	using System.Threading.Tasks;

Remember to delete imports you don't need after it's coded.

this. ForeColor //this is your code did you notice the space


You should be using a richTextBox instead of a label in your child form. Use this to change the size of the font:
ActiveMdiChild.Controls["richTextBox1"].Font = new Font(ActiveMdiChild.Controls["richTextBox1"].Font.Name, 8);

If you made the previous changes you should use this to change the font:
ActiveMdiChild.Controls["richTextBox1"].Font = new Font("Times New Roman", ActiveMdiChild.Controls["richTextBox1"].Font.Size);

If you made the previous changes you should use this to change the color:
ActiveMdiChild.Controls["richTextBox1"].ForeColor = Color.Black;
