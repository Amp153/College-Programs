Overall the code works. To fix the problem that you've mentioned in the beginning.
On the Form look at properties and then you can edit the Text from Form1 to TextEditorMDI

Now the problems that I saw but I think you missed.

You have unnessessary imports:
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.ComponentModel;
	using System.Data;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Text;
	using System.Threading.Tasks;

Remember to delete imports you don't need after it's coded.


You have these in your code but nothing is in them:
        private void menuToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

        }
        private void MyMDIForm_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

        }
        private void textColorToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

        }

Delete them, then go to the form, click on the error message to bring you to the designer, and delete the line that has the sgwiggles.
