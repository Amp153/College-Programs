have a button to execute the code and another to execute it.
have a website that explains everything to the user.


#Goal
I want to make a web site that that will check the weather at the usersÅ' location.

#Technology
My plan is to use Laravel.

#In-scope
-Get input from the user (their location) and display all the useful information that would be shown to the user from the chosen weather source.
-Allow the user to register an account that stores their name and password.
-Create a forum/message board that the user can enter to post, view any posts, leave a comment on a post, and view comments on a post.

#Out of scope
-This web site should look professional.
-If the web site is finished weeks before itÅfs due then I must add either another functionality or improve existing code.


php artisan serve
-starts the server
