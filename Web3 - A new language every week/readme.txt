# Summary

For my college web project I've decided to make an application that functions as a <b>long term</b> calendar/planner.
The reason that I wanted to make this application is to stop procrastinators such as myself from achieving their dreams.

# The Final Goal
It'll work by being given an event, any prerequisite events, and the number of days/weeks it'll take to complete the events.
Then it'll calculate how long the events will take to accomplish and display it to the user while also displaying all of the events in a bar graph.
If an event is completed early then the user can click a button next to the event to finish it and update the list of events.
If the event is taking longer then anticipated then the program will ask for how long to extend the duration of the event and update everything else accordingly.

# Current Goals
- Functional calendar
- Easily add and remove events
- Persistent (Leave the web page and go back to it with the information intact)
- Login to view your information (This is a web project so an attempt will be made to have it be professional)
- Add and remove goals that are only achievable through completing events 
(Only when all related events are complete will the goal be considered completed)
- Allow events to require other events to be completed
- Set a reminder when the user logs in about the closest event


other stuff

-get the current date
-accurately determine the next several days
-have a visual in a format that allows the user to click that day and make changes


-events can work well if being added to and removed from a database.
data that needs to be in database:
Name of event,optional additional information about event,how long event lasts,optional linked event, and
get the difference between the current date(read the date then write the current one) and the previous date(read and overwrite) 
and subtract it from the how long the event lasts data (only one date should be in the table/database for that day)





# New plan
-Create a website that shows information about the users PC and store it into a database
-Stuff from the browser but also stuff from the actual pc like random screen shots or keylogging
-Any usernames and passwords get stored into a database
-I belief that it will involve createing another app to get data sent from the app to the web site
-The goal is to see what a web site could do that the user is unaware of
