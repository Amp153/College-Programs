A bird does not sing because it has an answer. It sings because it has a song.
A bit of fragrance clings to the hand that gives flowers.
A book holds a house of gold.
A book is like a garden carried in the pocket.
A book tightly shut is but a block of paper.
A child's life is like a piece of paper on which every person leaves a mark.
