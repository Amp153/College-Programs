Discovery project 2
The 5 include files should be put together as described in Table 2-1
inc_header.php: 1 html statement to pull in the banner image
inc_button_nav.php: pull in the 9 button images
inc_text_links.php....
inc_footer.php......
inc_home.php .....

The 2 loop files - look god. FYI - in future chapters these files will be pulled into the main page, and hence you will not 
need any of the html header type pf tags

In the while loop file, change the 2nd for loop over to a while loop
